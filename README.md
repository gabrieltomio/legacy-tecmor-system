# Legacy Tecmor System

The Tecmor is a 3D molecular simulator, during computer technical course in 2014. Basically, the system transforms a molecule represented in 2D to 3D. More specifically, there is a constructor that receives as input the molecule (the linked atoms), and returns the position of each atom in the three-dimensional plane.
